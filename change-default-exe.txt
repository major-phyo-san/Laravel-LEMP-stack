example with Python
ls /usr/bin/python*
This will show you a list of available Python versions on your system.

sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python /usr/bin/python3.9 1
This command sets the /usr/bin/python3.9 executable as the default Python version, and assigns it a priority of 1.
